<!--
  Custom styles can be placed in a style tag. Make sure to always use the id of your main div
  element to limit the styles to their specific widget.
-->
<style type="text/css">
  #widget-example {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<!--
  Each widget should be wrapped in a div element with an unique id across all widgets allow
  custom styles and custom javascript to only target their own widget. You can place any HTML code
  in the widget div element.
-->
<div id="widget-example">
  Hello Widget!
</div>

<!--
  Include your custom javascript in this separate script tag element. A minimum example is provided
  below. You also have the following framework library functions available:

  Sciime.proxy(url, callback) - Returns the content of the url, which does not have to origin from
                                the same host. The callback is then triggered asynchronously (Ajax)
                                and given the content as a string.
-->
<script type="text/javascript">
  // Each widget has to define a unique namespace. The namespace holds a configuration section and
  // an init function. The namespace is the camelized filename.
  var WidgetExample = {

    configuration: {
      // The widget title is displayed in the hero unit above the widget.
      title: 'WidgetExample',

      // The description is displayed in the hero unit, below the title.
      description: 'This is a minimum example.',

      // The linkTitle is displayed in the navigation bar.
      linkTitle: 'Example'
    },

    // The init function is called everytime the widget will slide in next. You can preload any data
    // your widget needs, so it is instantly accessable when it is displayed.
